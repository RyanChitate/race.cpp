# race.cpp
Turbo Text Grand Prix â€“ A text-based race simulator written in C++ for a weekly mini-hackathon. Two cars race across an ASCII track, moving forward by random odd-numbered steps until one crosses the finish line. The program renders the race in the terminal and announces the winner (or a tie).
